--Pose questions that you have for Dr. Barrett in this file--

Will we need to move the old spreadsheet data to this application's database and format?

We know that Dr. Barrett needs to be able to skip questions. This is primarily for a
"grace" to students who can't answer the question. Will it ever occur that he skips a
question because the student has already passed that question's section of the exam?
Or will those questions be omitted from the pool of questions to be asked prior to 
the exam?
